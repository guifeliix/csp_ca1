                NFTs have been used to exchange digital tokens that link to a digital file asset. Ownership of an NFT is
                often associated with a license to use such a linked digital asset, but generally does not confer
                copyright to the buyer.
                Some agreements only grant a license for personal, non-commercial use, while other licenses also allow
                commercial use of the underlying digital asset.
                <br>

                <strong>Digital art</strong> <br>
                Some digital art NFTs, like these pixel art characters, are examples of generative art.
                Digital art is a common use case for NFTs. High-profile auctions of NFTs linked to digital art have
                received considerable public attention. The work entitled Merge by artist Pak was the most expensive
                NFT, with an
                auction price of US$91.8 million and Everydays: the First 5000 Days, by artist Mike Winkelmann (known
                professionally as Beeple), the second most expensive at US$69.3 million in 2021.
                Some NFT collections, including EtherRocks and CryptoPunks are examples of generative art, where many
                different images are created by assembling a selection of simple picture components in different
                combinations.
                In March 2021, the blockchain company Injective Protocol bought a $95,000 original screen print entitled
                Morons (White) from English graffiti artist Banksy, and filmed somebody burning it with a cigarette
                lighter.
                They minted and sold the video as an NFT. The person who destroyed the artwork, who called themselves
                "Burnt Banksy", described the act as a way to transfer a physical work of art to the NFT space.
                American curator and art historian Tina Rivers Ryan, who specializes in digital works, said that art
                museums are widely not convinced that NFTs have "lasting cultural relevance". Ryan compares NFTs to the
                net art fad
                before the dot-com bubble. No centralized means of authentication exists to prevent stolen and
                counterfeit digital works from being sold as NFTs, although auction houses like Sotheby's, Christie's,
                and various museums a
                and galleries worldwide started collaborations and partnerships with digital artists such as Refik
                Anadol, Dangiuz, and Sarah Zucker, selling NFTs associated with digital artworks (via NFT platforms) and
                showcasing those
                artworks (associated with the respective NFTs) both in virtual galleries and real life screens,
                monitors, and TVs.

                <strong>Games</strong> <br>
                NFTs can represent in-game assets, such as digital plots of land. Some commentators describe these as
                being controlled "by the user" instead of the game developer if they can be traded on third-party
                marketplaces without permission from the game developer.
                CryptoKitties was an early successful blockchain online game in which players adopt and trade virtual
                cats. The monetization of NFTs within the game raised a $12.5 million investment, with some kitties
                selling for over $100,000 each.
                Following its success, CryptoKitties was added to the ERC-721 standard, which was created in January
                2018 (and finalized in June). A similar NFT-based online game, Axie Infinity, was launched in March
                2018.
                In October 2021, developer Valve banned applications from their Steam platform if those applications use
                blockchain technology or NFTs to exchange value or game artifacts.
                In December 2021, Ubisoft announced Ubisoft Quartz, "an NFT initiative which allows people to buy
                artificially scarce digital items using cryptocurrency". The announcement prompted criticis, with a
                dislike ratio of 96%
                over the YouTube announcement video, which has since been unlisted. Some Ubisoft developers also raised
                their concern over the announcement. The Game Developers Conference's 2022 annual report stated that 70
                percent
                of developers surveyed said their studios had no interest in integrating NFTs or cryptocurrency into
                their games.
                Some luxury brands minted NFTs for online video game cosmetics. In November 2021, Morgan Stanley
                published a note suggesting that this use could become a multi-billion dollar market by 2030.
